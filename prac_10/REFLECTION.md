Regarding the estimates I did for practical tasks, I have low accuracy for each starting of the practical tasks.
Although, my accuracy of time and understanding for the practical task improves as I work through.
With this, it indicates my improvement of understanding and learning for the practices.


Regarding code reviews, I've learned how to improve my code from others and learned how to improve programming pattern.
Through being reviewed, I can view possible improvement and problems for my code.
On the other hand, doing review can practice on improving programming pattern, DRY and SRP.
Moreover, doing review can also see how other write their code in different way compare to mine.


Regarding the practical task overall, I would like to provide more example output or examples if I were in charge of the subject.
Because I had bad understanding when learning new stuff, which clear instruction is not enough.
With more example output or examples, it might help me to know how the new stuff work or how it relates to previous practices.


Proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that showed doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
